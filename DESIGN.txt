ALIEN ATTACK

A Non-scrolling Shooter.

Planet earth is under attack by an extraterrestrial species; use the arrow keys to rotate the angle of the shooter and the space bar to shoot the aliens closing in before it's too late.

Stay alive during the first attack to face the mothership in the second round, which must be shot many times to be defeated!
